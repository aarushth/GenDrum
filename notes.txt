params

-lower batch size

-increase epoch until validation loss stabilizes

-compare loss function over different training cycles




v_9

lowered batch size/learning rate
fixed labelling
added 70_15_15 test split


model struggles to differentiate claps and snaps.

v_10
increased weight decay

performance was worse

v_11 

reverted weight decay
increased epochs to 15

slightly better performance/ model is less certain on wrong answers between snap/clap

v_12

tried batch size 1

didn't work

v_13
reverted to batch size 2
increased epochs to 20
decreased learning rate to 0.0001

almost perfect !!!


v_14
lowered dropout to 0.4

slightly worse

v_15

reverted dropout to 0.5
added another linear layer

couldn't figure out snaps :(

v_16

deleted linear layer

worse for some reason

v_17

same as 13/16
